Household Power Consumption Dataset The Household Power Consumption dataset is a multivariate time series dataset that describes the electricity consumption for a single household over four years.

The data was collected between December 2006 and November 2010 and observations of power consumption within the household were collected every minute. It is a multivariate series comprised of seven variables (besides the date and time); they are:

global_active_power: The total active power consumed by the household (kilowatts).
global_reactive_power: The total reactive power consumed by the household (kilowatts).
voltage: Average voltage (volts).
global_intensity: Average current intensity (amps).
sub_metering_1: Active energy for kitchen (watt-hours of active energy).
sub_metering_2: Active energy for laundry (watt-hours of active energy).
sub_metering_3: Active energy for climate control systems (watt-hours of active energy).

Active and reactive energy refer to the technical details of alternative current.
In general terms, the active energy is the real power consumed by the household, whereas the reactive energy is the unused power in the lines. The dataset provides the active power as well as some division of the active power by main circuit in the house, specifically the kitchen, laundry, and climate control. These are not all the circuits in the household.

Context: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

Data Set Characteristics:
Multivariate, Time-Series

Associated Tasks:
Regression, Clustering

# Data Set Information:

This archive contains 2075259 measurements gathered between December 2006 and November 2010 (47 months).

### Notes:
1. (global_active_power*1000/60 - sub_metering_1 - sub_metering_2 - sub_metering_3) represents the active energy consumed every minute (in watt hour) in the household by electrical equipment not measured in sub-meterings 1, 2 and 3.

2. The dataset contains some missing values in the measurements (nearly 1,25% of the rows). All calendar timestamps are present in the dataset but for some timestamps, the measurement values are missing: a missing value is represented by the absence of value between two consecutive semi-colon attribute separators. For instance, the dataset shows missing values on April 28, 2007.

### Attributes Information:
1. date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
2. time: time in format hh:mm:ss
3. global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
4. global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
5. voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
6. global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
7. sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
8. sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9. sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
